# Stage 4: Turbulence

## Overview

Stage 4 solves the gyrokinetic equations to compute turbulent transport. The primary outputs -- heat and particle fluxes -- are both optimization objectives (to minimize) AND direct transport inputs for Stage 5.

**JAX-first priority:** `GKX` is the primary code (JAX-native, differentiable). `GX` and `GENE` are traditional alternatives added later.

**Position in pipeline:** Receives geometry from Stage 1/2. Runs in parallel with Stage 3 (Neoclassical). Outputs feed Stage 5 (Transport).

**Important coordination point:** The coupling between `GKX` output and `NEOPAX` (Stage 5) is less mature than the `GX`-`Trinity3D` coupling. `NEOPAX` has turbulence-coupling utilities but the public examples focus on the neoclassical reduced model. The Stage 4 and 5 owners must coordinate on this interface.

## Input Specification

Reference: `stellarator_io_reference.tex`, Sections 3.9-3.10.

### GKX Inputs

| Field | Type | Description | Source |
|-------|------|-------------|--------|
| TOML config | file | Grid, geometry, physics toggles, time integration | User-specified |
| Geometry | analytic or `*.eik.nc` | Magnetic geometry (can be VMEC-derived) | Stage 1/2 |
| Species profiles | in config | Density, temperature, gradients per species | User-specified |
| Collisionality | in config | Collision parameters | User-specified |
| Beta | in config | Electromagnetic parameter | User-specified |

Required input fields:
- `species`: Defines the physical properties of the active plasma species.
     - Default: ion with `charge=1.0, mass=1.0, density=1.0, temperature=1.0, tprim=2.49, fprim=0.8, nu=0.0, kinetic=True`. (The code seems to have a default. But does not seem to run with not specifying it.)
- `geometry`: Specifies the magnetic equilibrium and flux surface geometry.
- `physics`: Sets the global physical assumptions for the plasma.
- `run`: Configures the execution mode.

Optional input fields:
- `grid`: Defines the resolution of the simulated phase-space.

     - Defaults: `Nx=48, Ny=48, Nz=64, Lx=62.8, Ly=62.8, boundary="periodic", jtwist=None, non_twist=False, kxfac=1.0, z_min=-pi, z_max=pi, y0=None, ntheta=None, nperiod=None, zp=None`

- `time`: Specifies time configurations.
     - Defaults: `t_max=100.0, dt=0.1, method="rk2", sample_stride=1, diagnostics_stride=1, diagnostics=True, save_state=False, checkpoint=False, implicit_restart=20, implicit_preconditioner=None, implicit_solve_method="batched", use_diffrax=True, diffrax_solver="Dopri8", diffrax_adaptive=False, diffrax_rtol=1e-5, diffrax_atol=1e-7, diffrax_max_steps=4096, progress_bar=False, fixed_dt=True, dt_min=1e-7, dt_max=None, cfl=0.9, cfl_fac=None, collision_split=False, collision_scheme="implicit", gx_real_fft=True, nonlinear_dealias=True, laguerre_nonlinear_mode="grid"`

- `init`: Controls how the initial perturbation is built.
     - Defaults: `init_field="density", init_amp=1e-5, init_single=True, random_seed=22, gaussian_init=False, gaussian_width=0.5, gaussian_envelope_constant=1.0, gaussian_envelope_sine=0.0, kpar_init=0.0, init_file=None, init_file_scale=1.0, init_file_mode="replace", init_electrons_only=False`
- `collisions`: Configures the collision operator. Controls collision, hypercollision, and end-damping parameters.
     - Defaults: `nu_hermite=1.0, nu_laguerre=2.0, nu_hyper=0.0, p_hyper=4.0, nu_hyper_l=0.0, nu_hyper_m=1.0, nu_hyper_lm=0.0, p_hyper_l=6.0, p_hyper_m=None, p_hyper_lm=6.0, D_hyper=0.0, p_hyper_kperp=2.0, hypercollisions_const=0.0, hypercollisions_kz=1.0, damp_ends_amp=0.1, damp_ends_widthfrac=0.125, damp_ends_scale_by_dt=False`. Note `p_hyper_m=None` is not a hard numeric default; the runtime follows the GX fallback min(20, Nm/2) when it is omitted.
- `normalization`: Sets the reference units used to non-dimensionalize the equations. 
     - Defaults: `contract="cyclone", rho_star=None, omega_d_scale=None, omega_star_scale=None, diagnostic_norm="gx", flux_scale=1.0, wphi_scale=1.0`

     - Defaults: `streaming=1.0, mirror=1.0, curvature=1.0, gradb=1.0, diamagnetic=1.0, , collisions=1.0, hypercollisions=1.0, hyperdiffusion=0.0, end_damping=1.0, apar=1.0, bpar=1.0, nonlinear=0.0`
- `experts`: Advanced special-purpose controls.
     - Defaults: `fixed_mode=False, iky_fixed=None, ikx_fixed=None, dealias_kz=False`
- `output`: Artifact-output controls, including whether the spectrally resolved diagnostics are retained. `resolved_diagnostics=False` skips the per-sample kx/ky/z arrays, leaving the scalar traces the flux reduction reads untouched.
     - Defaults: `path=None, restart=False, restart_if_exists=False, save_for_restart=True, restart_to_file=None, restart_from_file=None, restart_with_perturb=False, append_on_restart=True, resolved_diagnostics=True, restart_scale=1.0, nsave=10000`

> [!NOTE]
> **Radial-scan bridge shaping tiers and reproducibility.** The defaults listed above are the raw GKX config defaults. The `gkx_radial_scan.py` bridge that the Snakemake forward pass runs generates a runtime TOML per flux surface rather than using the template verbatim, and resolves each shaping setting in three tiers, taking the first that is set. The tiers are the `stage4.gkx` key in the run config, then the matching key in the GKX template, then a hard fallback in the bridge. The quick-run config sets `nx`, `ny`, `ntheta`, `t_max`, `sample_stride` and `diagnostics_stride`, so for that run those come from the run config and the template's `[grid]` and `[time]` values never apply; `nz` has no run-config key and comes from the template. The bridge fallbacks are `Nx = 48`, `Ny = 48`, `t_max = 100.0`, `sample_stride = 1` and `diagnostics_stride = 1`, which are GKX's own defaults, together with `ntheta = 48` (theta points for the generated VMEC geometry), which GKX leaves unset. A fallback applies only where a template omits that key, and a template omitting both `diagnostics_stride` and `resolved_diagnostics` falls back to sampling every step with the resolved spectra retained, the combination that accumulates host RAM across a long run. The bridge also emits an `[output]` table carrying `resolved_diagnostics`, which defaults to `true` to match GKX and is set per run from `stage4.gkx.resolved_diagnostics` or the template's own `[output]` table. The bridge does **not** emit `random_seed` into the generated TOMLs, so the GKX default seed is left implicit and runs are not explicitly re-seeded through this path (a known reproducibility gap). The scan's `response_mode` defaults to `none`; in `fd_gradients` mode, unset `dkap_density` / `dkap_temperature` / `perturb_rel_step` each default to `0.5`.

Output in CSV files, along with a json file that records the info for only last time step. These are the per-surface diagnostics; in the Snakemake forward pass they are written under each surface's run directory and reduced into the aggregated files below.

#### Aggregated forward-pass outputs (radial scan)

The Snakemake forward pass runs the GKX radial scan as a per-surface fan-out (`stage4_prepare` checkpoint, one `stage4_run_one` job per flux surface, then `stage4_collect`; see [Per-surface fan-out](../mvp-pipeline.md#per-surface-fan-out-stages-3-and-4)). The `collect` step reduces the per-surface diagnostics into two HDF5 files.

**Forward-chain handoff:** `neopax_fluxes.h5` (HDF5), consumed by `NEOPAX` (Stage 5). Its schema is the exact subset checked by the in-repo contract validator `src/io_contracts.py` (`validate_neopax_fluxes`):

| Dataset | Shape | Meaning |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `rho` | `(n_radii,)` | Normalized radial coordinate (sorted ascending) |
| `r` | `(n_radii,)` | Physical minor-radius coordinate `r = a * rho` |
| `Gamma` | `(n_species, n_radii)` | Turbulent particle flux in NEOPAX units |
| `Q` | `(n_species, n_radii)` | Turbulent heat flux in NEOPAX units |
| `Upar` | `(n_species, n_radii)` | Parallel flow; **always written as zeros** (this path supplies no parallel-flow channel) |
| `meta/species_names` | `(n_species,)` | UTF-8 species labels (dataset inside the `meta` group) |

Required `meta` group attributes (checked by the contract): `particle_flux_units = "m^-2 s^-1"`, `heat_flux_units = "eV m^-2 s^-1"`, and `minor_radius_m`. The `meta` group also carries `rho_star_source`, `radial_flux_coordinate`, `conversion`, `reference_species_name`, and `manifest` provenance attributes. The scan now samples the transport face grid, whose full radial coordinate includes the magnetic axis at `rho = 0`; the executed GKX runs still skip that axis point, so when the manifest records the full face grid with only its non-axis entries scanned the `collect` step re-inserts a zero-flux `rho = 0` column before writing, restoring the complete face-grid profile for Stage 5.

**Radial-grid adapter (`stage4.neopax_radius_relabel`).** The `r` column above is `Aminor_p * rho` from VMEC, while Stage 5 interpolates the file onto a grid it builds from its own minor radius. NEOPAX derives that radius as `a_b = sqrt(volume_p / (2 pi^2 R00_boozer))`, taking `R00` from the Boozer file rather than VMEC's `Rmajor_p`. VMEC satisfies `volume_p = 2 pi^2 Rmajor_p Aminor_p^2`, so the two differ by exactly that substitution, and which one is larger depends on the equilibrium. Measured as `a_b/Aminor_p - 1`, W7-X gives `+0.83%` and the shipped HSX case `-1.04%`. Where NEOPAX's grid is the wider one its outermost cell falls outside the file's knots and `interpax` returns NaN there rather than raising, which reaches the pressure RHS and stalls the solve at zero steps. Newer NEOPAX revisions reject such a file at model construction instead. Independently of coverage, `[turbulence] lagged_response_mode = "fd"` requires the two grids to be equal to within `1e-12`.

Setting `stage4.neopax_radius_relabel` to a convention name runs `stages/stage4-turbulence/relabel_neopax_flux_radius.py` at the end of `stage4_collect`, rewriting `r` as `a * rho` for that convention so every knot sits at the radius Stage 5 means by it. Where the flux file also samples the same face-grid `rho` points NEOPAX grids, the knots coincide with its interpolation targets and the interpolation becomes an identity; a scan that subsampled radii still interpolates between knots, but from correctly placed ones. `"boozer_volume"` targets the grid NEOPAX builds today and is the only convention defined so far; `false` (the default) writes the grid through unchanged. The key names a convention rather than switching a boolean, so a NEOPAX that grids differently becomes a new name and a config edit rather than a revert. Only `r` is rewritten, so the flux values keep the gyro-Bohm normalization Stage 4 applied. The step is idempotent, and a rewritten file records `neopax_radius_relabel_applied`, `neopax_radius_relabel_convention`, `neopax_radius_relabel_a_minor_m` (the minor radius relabelled onto) and `neopax_radius_relabel_original_r_edge_m` (the file's outermost knot before the rewrite, `Aminor_p * rho[-1]`) in its `meta` group. The flux file's `rho` grid must cover `[0, rho_edge]` for `[geometry].rho_edge` from `common_input.toml`, since either end stopping short leaves the matching end of NEOPAX's grid outside the knots, where interpolation returns NaN. Both comparisons are exact and one-sided rather than tolerant, because interpax admits no tolerance of its own and a knot one ulp inside a target still leaves it uncovered; covering more than the interval is accepted. A scan that subsamples radii through `rho_min`, `num_radii` or `rho_indices` produces a grid starting above 0 and is rejected for that reason, because `collect` re-inserts the magnetic axis only for a scan that covered every other face. Interior spacing is deliberately unconstrained, since a sparse grid covering the interval is a valid input for NEOPAX to interpolate from; `lagged_response_mode = "fd"` additionally needs the grids equal point for point, and NEOPAX enforces that itself at model construction.

**Optional perturbed-flux datasets (finite-difference response mode).** When the manifest contains perturbed runs (Stage 4 config `response_mode: fd_gradients`), `collect` additionally writes the datasets below, keyed on a perturbation axis of length `n_perturb` (one entry per distinct `(response_label, perturb_species)` pair, in first-seen manifest order). The base `Gamma` / `Q` / `rho` / `r` datasets are still computed from base runs only. These are additions outside the `validate_neopax_fluxes` required subset (the validator checks only the required fields and ignores extra datasets). Stage 5 reads all six of them whenever its `common_input.toml` sets `[turbulence] lagged_response_mode = "fd"`, where NEOPAX takes `Gamma_perturbed` / `Q_perturbed` under those names or the shorter `Gamma_perturb` / `Q_perturb`, requires `perturb_delta` and `perturb_present`, and reads the perturbation labels from the `(response_label, perturb_species)` pair written here. That mode additionally requires the file's `r` grid to equal NEOPAX's own to within `1e-12`, so it presumes the radial-grid adapter above.

The stored density perturbations preserve the pressure gradient, giving slopes `dF/dkappa_n - dF/dkappa_T`. The [pinned NEOPAX reader](https://github.com/uwplasma/NEOPAX/blob/9034aafdb6e57beaf8fea8922ce838fbfb738763/NEOPAX/_transport_flux_models.py) applies independent density and temperature coordinates. Using these slopes directly would therefore omit the `dF/dkappa_T * delta_kappa_n` contribution. Align the response basis before enabling FD transport. The radial-grid adapter does not correct this basis mismatch. See the [coupling follow-up](../potential_issues.md#stage-5----transport).

| Dataset | Shape | Meaning |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `Gamma_perturbed` | `(n_perturb, n_species, n_radii)` | Turbulent particle flux from the perturbed-gradient runs; same NEOPAX-unit conversion and units as `Gamma` |
| `Q_perturbed` | `(n_perturb, n_species, n_radii)` | Turbulent heat flux from the perturbed-gradient runs; same units as `Q` |
| `perturb_delta` | `(n_perturb, n_radii)` | Signed gradient increment applied for that (channel, species, surface) |
| `perturb_present` | `(n_perturb, n_radii)`, bool | True where a perturbed run exists; surfaces without one (including a re-inserted magnetic-axis column) hold zeros and False |
| `response_label` | `(n_perturb,)` | Perturbed gradient channel (`density_gradient` or `temperature_gradient`), jointly keying the first axis of the arrays above with `perturb_species`; never `base` |
| `perturb_species` | `(n_perturb,)` | Perturbed species name, verbatim, jointly keying the first axis with `response_label`; never `none` |

**Companion aggregate:** `flux_summary.h5` (HDF5) -- the richer scan summary the plots and audits build on. It holds one entry per executed run, in manifest order: base runs plus, in `fd_gradients` response mode, the perturbed sibling runs, so every top-level array has the same per-run length and the magnetic-axis re-insertion described above never applies to this file (that is a `neopax_fluxes.h5`-only behavior). Top-level datasets are `rho`, `r`, `rho_index`, `torflux`, `Er`, `heat_flux_total`, `particle_flux_total`, the averaging-window bounds, and the per-run identity fields also recorded in `runs.csv` (`response_label`, `perturb_species`, `perturb_delta`); the `(response_label, perturb_species)` pair (`base`/`none`, or `density_gradient` / `temperature_gradient` with a species name -- `perturb_species` is `none` exactly on `base` rows) is what distinguishes base rows from perturbed rows sitting at duplicate `rho` values, and perturbed rows share their base surface's `rho_index`, which is the key grouping a finite-difference stencil. Note that the per-run `response_label` / `perturb_species` datasets here differ in shape and role from the `n_perturb`-long axis datasets of the same names in `neopax_fluxes.h5`, which never contain `base` / `none`. A `species` group (`names`, `heat_flux`, `particle_flux`) and a `meta` group complete the file. It is not read by Stage 5.

**Per-surface run tree** (under `outputs/<run>/stage4_turbulence/`): `manifest.json` at the stage directory records the surfaces, geometry, and profile provenance the `collect` step reduces over; `runs.csv` and `normalization_audit.csv` summarize the planned runs; `runs/rho_*/` holds one directory per surface (basenames like `rho_012_r0p4898`), each with the generated runtime `input.toml`, the local geometry cache `*.eik.nc`, `run.diagnostics.csv` (the per-surface time traces `collect` reads), and `run.summary.json`. In `fd_gradients` response mode each base surface additionally gets perturbed sibling directories `rho_*_fd_n_<species>` (density-gradient channel) and `rho_*_fd_t_<species>` (temperature-gradient channel), one per configured channel-species pair, with the same per-directory contents as a base run; the directory suffix is derived from the run's identity fields via the fixed channel map `density_gradient -> fd_n`, `temperature_gradient -> fd_t`. Every run record in `manifest.json` and every row in `runs.csv` carries `response_label` (`base`, `density_gradient`, or `temperature_gradient`), `perturb_species` (`none` on base records, otherwise the perturbed species name verbatim), and `perturb_delta` (the signed gradient increment, `0.0` on base runs); perturbed records inherit their base surface's `rho_index`, so `rho_index` joins a base run to its finite-difference siblings. `none` and `base` are reserved words rejected (case-insensitively) as perturbation species names, since each marks unperturbed runs in one of the identity fields. The manifest header additionally records `response_mode`, `perturb_density_species`, `perturb_temperature_species`, `dkap_density`, `dkap_temperature`, and `perturb_rel_step`, plus `profiles_source`: one of `analytical`, `transport_h5`, or `prescribed` (`transport_h5` reads the solution's `rho_face` / `*_faces` face state, not its cell-centered datasets), the same three sources the [Stage 3 spec](../stage3-neoclassical/spec.md) documents. `prescribed` reads SI profile arrays written into the `common_input.toml` `[profiles]` block by the closed loop's Stage 5 post-processing; see [Closing the Loop](../mvp-pipeline.md#closing-the-loop) for the array contract. It reads that block's `*_face` arrays and samples the transport **face** grid `linspace(0, rho_edge, n_radial + 1)`, not the cell-centered arrays NEOPAX itself reads back; a block carrying only the centered arrays is rejected rather than extrapolated. Under `analytical`, an unset `analytical_n_radii` falls back to that same face grid, and the flag counts **faces** in either case, so a value of `n_radial + 1` reproduces the transport grid and anything else grids a flux file NEOPAX interpolates from more finely or more coarsely than its own faces.

**Where the profile gradients come from.** The `tprim` and `fprim` written into each runtime TOML are `-temperature_grad / T_face` and `-density_grad / n_face` at the same face (the divisor floored by `--temperature-floor` / `--density-floor`), with the gradients taken exactly as they arrive and no minor radius or coordinate change applied to them. The scan never differentiates a profile of its own. GKX defines `tprim = -(a/T) dT/dr` on `r = a * rho`, which is the radial coordinate NEOPAX grids on, so the minor radius cancels and a per-rho gradient is exactly what GKX wants. (These are the radial profile gradients that drive every run. They are unrelated to the `density_gradient` / `temperature_gradient` values of `response_label`, which name the finite-difference perturbation channels of `response_mode: fd_gradients`.) Each `profiles_source` supplies them differently:

- **`transport_h5`** reads `density_grad_faces` / `temperature_grad_faces` from the solution and rescales them from per metre onto rho by `r_grid_half[-1] / rho_face[-1]`, the minor radius relating the file's own two face grids.
- **`prescribed`** reads `density_grad_face` / `temperature_grad_face` out of the `[profiles]` block, where the Stage 5 writer has already put them per unit rho.
- **`analytical`** has no NEOPAX run to read from, so it reproduces NEOPAX's operator instead of inventing one. The profile formula is sampled on the **cell centers** `0.5 * (faces[:-1] + faces[1:])`, with its shape functions normalized by `rho_edge` rather than by the outermost sample, and then `stages/common/profile_gradients.py`, a NumPy port of NEOPAX's `CellVariable.face_grad` and `CellVariable.face_value`, builds both the face values and the face gradients from those centers under the run's `[boundary]` blocks. The port runs on the metre grid `a * rho_faces` that NEOPAX itself differences against, so a `robin` boundary's `decay_length` and a `neumann` boundary's `gradient` keep the units their config values carry, and the per-metre derivative is multiplied by `a` on the way out. `Er` goes the same way. `[boundary.Er.right]` accepts `floating_ambipolar_edge` and `ambipolar_edge_root`, which name an ambipolar solve rather than a closure, and the port implements neither; NEOPAX does not hand them to its own face operator either, rewriting the side to a zero-gradient `neumann` edge first, and the same rewrite is applied here. The face **values** are reconstructed from the centers as well, not just the gradients, because that is what NEOPAX does, so this path does not reproduce runs made before it existed.

The `a` the analytical path needs is NEOPAX's minor radius, not VMEC's `Aminor_p` (the radial-grid adapter above defines it), which is why `prepare` reads `volume_p` from the wout and `R00` from the Boozer file and fails when either is unresolvable. VMEC's radius still sets `rho_star` and `r_physical`, which are GKX normalization quantities rather than statements about NEOPAX's grid.

The natural downstream contract is the same as `GX`: turbulent heat and particle flux (steady-state values).

### Subset Handed to Next Stage

For transport coupling, the critical handoff is the **turbulent flux vector** (steady-state heat and particle flux per species). For screening, only linear gamma and omega may be retained.

`Trinity3D` obtains flux Jacobians by rerunning `GX` on perturbed gradients and finite-differencing.

### Outputs Used as Objectives

- Linear gamma, omega: rapid screening
- Nonlinear heat flux, particle flux: high-fidelity design objectives
- Heat flux is BOTH an objective AND a transport input (dual-role output)

## Scripts & Workflows

**`GKX` (via Pixi):** From the `stages`/ directory:

```
pixi run stage-4-gkx
```

which executes something morally equivalent to:

```
python -m gkx.cli run --config inputs/quick_run/HSX_vacuum_ns201_quickrun.toml --out outputs/quick_run/stage4_turbulence/hsx_run_quickrun
```

> [!NOTE]
> The pixi `stage-4-gkx` task runs a **single** `gkx run` over the template TOML -- it is not the radial scan. The radial scan is the separate `stage-4-gkx-radial-scan` task, which fans one `python -m gkx.cli run` subprocess out per flux surface.

**Input:** `outputs/quick_run/stage1_equilibrium/wout_HSX_vacuum_ns201_quickrun.nc` + `inputs/quick_run/HSX_vacuum_ns201_quickrun.toml`
**Output:** the `stage-4-gkx-radial-scan` collect step writes `outputs/quick_run/stage4_turbulence/neopax_fluxes.h5` (+ `flux_summary.h5`, `manifest.json`, `runs.csv`); the single-run task above writes under its own `--out` prefix.

> [!NOTE]
> The TOML's `vmec_file` points into `outputs/quick_run/stage1_equilibrium/`. Populate this directory by running `pixi run stage-1-vmex` first. The VMEC geometry path also requires `booz_xform_jax` at runtime (lazy dependency).

See `docs/mvp-pipeline.md` for full I/O details.

> [!TODO]
> Add standalone run scripts and workflows for `GX` and `GENE`.

## Container Specification (Phase 2)

**`GKX`:** Built from the single templated `stages/Dockerfile` using build arguments:

```
docker build --file stages/Dockerfile --build-arg ENVIRONMENT=stage-4-gkx stages/        # CPU
docker build --file stages/Dockerfile --build-arg ENVIRONMENT=stage-4-gkx-gpu --build-arg CUDA_VERSION=12 stages/  # GPU
```

Published to GHCR as `ghcr.io/driftless-star/driftless-star:stage-4-gkx-cpu` and `stage-4-gkx-gpu`. CI builds via `.github/workflows/containers.yml`.

See [guide](../guide.md#container-architecture) for full architecture details.

> [!TODO]
> Define container specifications for `GX` and `GENE`.

> See [guide](../guide.md#step-7-create-claude-skills) for skill types.

## Profile beta and self-collisionality

To calculate beta and species self-collision frequencies from the NEOPAX face state and VMEC geometry, set these values under `stage4.gkx`.

```yaml
beta_source: profiles
collisionality_source: profiles
collisionality_scaling_factor: 1.0
```

Each source independently accepts `fixed` or `profiles` and defaults to `fixed`. Fixed beta uses the CLI value, then the template value, then zero. Fixed ion and electron collision frequencies default to 0.01 and 0.0. The scaling factor must be finite and nonnegative. It affects only profile collision frequencies. A value of 0.0 disables collisions in profile mode.

Profile beta does not enable electromagnetic physics. In the GKX template, enable `physics.electromagnetic`, the desired `physics.use_apar` and/or `physics.use_bpar` fields, and their `terms.apar` and/or `terms.bpar` weights. The shipped template disables electromagnetic physics, so its effective beta stays zero. Existing collision and hypercollision switches and term weights still apply.

The pipeline and radial scan calculate parameters each time they prepare inputs, including the first run. They use the selected analytical, prescribed, or transport-HDF5 face state and requested time slice. Gradient perturbations keep their base surface's beta and collision frequencies. Stage 5 feedback uses prescribed profiles. A frozen Stage 4 reuses its flux file. Direct `gkx run` does not perform these calculations. The CLI equivalents are `--beta-source`, `--collisionality-source`, and `--collisionality-scaling-factor`.

The formulas follow [pinned T3D Species.py](https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/gyrokinetics/t3d/src/74a06dfdf8e005e6bc72ef79859413ba69abd626/t3d/Species.py). Density is in 1e20 m^-3, temperature in keV, and mass in proton units. Beta is `0.0403 n_ref T_ref / B_ref^2`. The self-collision rate is `285 Z^4 n lnLambda / (sqrt(A) T^1.5)` in inverse seconds, including electron-electron collisions. GKX receives this rate multiplied by `L_ref / v_ref` and the scaling factor, where `L_ref = Aminor_p`, `B_ref = abs(phi_edge) / (pi L_ref^2)`, and `v_ref = sqrt(1000 e T_ref / m_p)`. VMEC must supply explicit `Aminor_p` and, for beta, `phi`. Invalid physical inputs fail preparation instead of using normalization floors.

`normalization_audit.csv` and `.json` record physical inputs, calculated parameters, and effective field and collision terms. New manifests require successful diagnostics and a completion marker matching the prepared inputs. Changed inputs require preparation again. Collection rejects untrusted results unless `--allow-incomplete` is explicit (`--collect-even-if-failures` in the full scan). Incomplete exports are marked and must not serve as complete transport input. Older manifests retain their previous completion behavior.

Full T3D+GX equivalence remains unverified. Species mass normalization, absolute physical-flux conversion, and collision-operator equivalence are unresolved. This feature preserves the existing mass and flux conventions. The [pinned GKX acceptance script](../../tests/stage4-turbulence/acceptance/pinned_gkx.py) includes reproduction instructions and checks parameter loading and execution, not converged transport agreement.
