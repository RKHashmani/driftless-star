"""Tests for the per-iteration configuration record written by ``src.ouroboros``, the closed-loop driver.

The verbatim config copy in each iteration's ``input/`` directory describes the run as it was written,
not as it was launched. The driver's placement flags (``--gpu-ids``, ``--jobs-per-gpu``,
``--container-runtime``) are handed to Snakemake as ``--config`` entries, which override the config
file's values without editing the file itself. ``--gpu-ids`` is the dangerous half of that gap, because
it decides whether every stage runs in a cpu or a gpu container image.

``effective_config.yaml`` closes the gap by recording the config with this invocation's overrides
applied. These tests check that it captures those overrides, that one is written for every iteration
using that iteration's own directories, and that it sits beside the verbatim copy rather than replacing
it -- the pair records both what was supplied and what actually ran.

The tests exercise the driver's real control flow with its two file-touching collaborators replaced by
stand-ins, so no solver and no Snakemake ever start and every path stays under pytest's ``tmp_path``.
