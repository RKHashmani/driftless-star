"""Tests for ``src.utils.paths.resolve_pipeline_paths``.

``resolve_pipeline_paths`` is the single source of truth the Snakefile and the
closed-loop driver both use to turn one run's config into concrete file paths.
A change that silently alters a derived path would mis-wire the stages, so these
tests pin the path contract against the committed quick_run config and against a
minimal synthetic config that exercises the ``{run_name}`` templating in isolation.
