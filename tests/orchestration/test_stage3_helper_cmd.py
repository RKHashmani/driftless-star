"""Tests for the ``src.stage3_helper`` per-phase command composers.

``prepare_cmd``, ``run_one_cmd``, and ``collect_cmd`` turn the ``stage3.dkx``
config block into the three shell commands that the Snakefile's per-phase Stage 3
rules run. The exact strings are the contract with those rules, so this pins them:
the static base flags (including the literal ``{input.*}`` and ``{wildcards.surf}``
placeholders Snakemake substitutes at run time), the not-None-only optional flags
on ``prepare``, the tri-state booleans, and the absence of scan-level parallelism
and GPU flags now that surface concurrency belongs to ``snakemake --cores`` and
device assignment to the docker prefix.
