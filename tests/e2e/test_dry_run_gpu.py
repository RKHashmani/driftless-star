"""Dry-run tests of the GPU wiring the Snakefile plans into every container launch.

``snakemake -n -p`` resolves the GPU pool config and formats every stage's shell
command without starting a container, so the three modes can be told apart from the
planned text alone on a machine with no GPU and no Docker.

What is pinned here is the boundary between the modes. A cpu run must plan no GPU
container flag, while both GPU modes must route every device-taking container launch
through the allocator, because one unwrapped launch would take a device the allocator
believes is free. Steps that only rewrite a file are planned with neither a device nor
the allocator and are counted out, since the guarantee is that no launch reaches a
device unallocated rather than that every launch takes one. The two GPU modes differ
only in where the pool comes from. An explicit list is planned as ids, and "all" is
planned as the word itself, since the host's own ids are resolved by the allocator when
the job starts. The malformed cases pin that the pool is resolved at parse time, so a
typo costs nothing rather than failing hours into a run.

The ``_dry_run`` helper is shared with the DAG tests, which documents the isolation it
applies to keep every write under tmp.
