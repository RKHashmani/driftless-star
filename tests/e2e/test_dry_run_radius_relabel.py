"""Dry-run tests of the Stage 4 radial-grid relabelling step the Snakefile plans into ``stage4_collect``.

``snakemake -n -p`` formats the rule's shell command without starting a container, so the whole
composed line can be asserted on. What matters here is the composition rather than the flags, which
``tests/orchestration/test_stage4_helper_cmd.py`` already pins. What has to hold is that the step is
absent by default, and that when present it is chained and grouped so that a collect failure still
fails the rule and both commands' output still reaches the log.

The ``_dry_run`` helper is shared with the DAG tests, which documents the isolation it applies to
keep every write under tmp.
