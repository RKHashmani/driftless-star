"""Opportunistic contract checks against the real pipeline baseline outputs.

The other ``tests/io_contracts`` modules build synthetic files and prove the validators in
``src/io_contracts.py`` flag the right defects. This module is the complement: it runs those
same five file validators against the actual, gitignored baseline artifacts produced by a
local pipeline run, so a re-run whose upstream solver drifted (a renamed dataset, a
transposed axis, a dropped variable from a breaking dependency bump) is caught here rather
than silently downstream.

Discovery reads the committed ``inputs/quick_run/config.yaml`` and resolves paths through
``src.utils.resolve_pipeline_paths`` for both output layouts: the plain forward pass
(``outputs/quick_run/stageN_.../``) and every closed-loop iteration
(``outputs/quick_run/loop/iter_*/output/stageN_.../``), mirroring how the loop driver and
``tests/orchestration/test_ouroboros.py`` build iteration paths. Whichever of those exist on
this machine are validated.

Because ``outputs/`` is gitignored, CI and fresh clones have no baseline: each parametrized
case then finds zero files and skips with a clear reason instead of failing. The whole module
is marked ``requires_baseline`` (registered in ``pytest.ini``) so it can also be selected or
excluded explicitly.
